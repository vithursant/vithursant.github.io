On March 20, 2018, I gave a talk to the Machine Learning Research Group (MLRG)
at the University of Guelph on continual learning, also called lifelong
learning, which has been a hot research topic in recent years. Here, I reviewed
a NIPS 2017 paper called <i>Gradient Episodic Memory for Continual Learning</i>
by David-Lopez Paz and Marc'Aurelio Ranzato from Facebook AI Research (FAIR).
