On November 28, 2017, I gave a talk to the Machine Learning Research Group
(MLRG) at the University of Guelph on different methods for teaching neural
networks how to learn efficiently and effectively. Here, I reviewed a several
methods in the literature such as: curriculum learning [1], variants of self-paced
learning [2, 3], machine teaching [5] and meta-learning [4].
