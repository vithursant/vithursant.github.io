  description: We introduce Self-Paced Learning with Adaptive Deep Visual Embeddings (SPL-ADVisE), 
              a novel end-to-end training protocol that unites self-paced learning (SPL) and deep 
              metric learning (DML). Our architecture combines the strength of adaptive sampling, 
              the efficiency of mini-batch online learning, and the flexibility of representation learning to
              form an effective self-paced strategy in an end-to-end DNN training protocol.
