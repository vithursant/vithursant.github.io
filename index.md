<i>“I do think it’s important to follow your dreams and do something which you
are excited by. If you follow your heart and do what you like, you will always
do much better. It doesn’t matter what your educational qualification is."</i>

I am a Graduate Student Researcher at <a

Guelph's</a> Machine Learning Research Group (MLRG) and the <a

Artificial Intelligence</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.gwtaylor.ca/"

I am a design-minded engineer focused on embedding artificial intelligence into
applications that can transform our world in ways many of us can barely imagine.
As a machine learning researcher, I am interested in developing
continual/lifelong learning algorithms that allow deep neural networks to
continually evolve over time and dynamically adapt to unseen real-world
environments, and improve as they operate. I enjoy bridging the gap between
machine learning research and engineering — combining my technical knowledge
with my strengths in engineering design.

When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably playing basketball,
working out at the gym, or drawing landscapes, architectures or cars with
pencil.
