<br />
Welcome! I'm Vithursan Thangarasa, a dedicated machine learning and artificial intelligence professional with a rich background in engineering systems and computing. My journey in this fascinating field began with my Master of Applied Science from the University of Guelph, focusing on lifelong learning algorithms.

<br />
Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of contributing to groundbreaking projects at Cerebras Systems, Uber AI Labs, and Tesla, pushing the boundaries of neural network training, computer vision, and deep learning algorithms. My work not only reflects my commitment to innovation but also my passion for solving complex problems with technology.

<br />
Join me as I continue to explore the limitless possibilities of AI, aiming to
inspire and be inspired by the ever-evolving machine learning landscape.

I am a Graduate Student Researcher at <a

Guelph's</a> Machine Learning Research Group (MLRG) and the <a

Artificial Intelligence</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.gwtaylor.ca/"

I am a design-minded engineer focused on embedding artificial intelligence into
applications that can transform our world in ways many of us can barely imagine.
As a machine learning researcher, I am interested in developing
continual/lifelong learning algorithms that allow deep neural networks to
continually evolve over time and dynamically adapt to unseen real-world
environments, and improve as they operate. I enjoy bridging the gap between
machine learning research and engineering — combining my technical knowledge
with my strengths in engineering design. -->

When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably playing basketball,
working out at the gym, or drawing landscapes, architectures or cars with
pencil.
